# sudo-tunic
A small, browser based mini game, used to present a family member with puzzles inspired from the game [Tunic](https://tunicgame.com/).

The project is a very simple NodeJS App. And you will need a gamepad connected to your PC in order to play.

# Running
In order to start, simply run `npm ci` and `npm start`. The App listens by default on port 3000. Alternatively use the [Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ledmonds/testing-node/tags).
